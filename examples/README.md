# Stack
When we talk about a stack, we usually relate it to a row in a bank or maybe when we stack dishes in our kitchen.

What does that mean?

The stack is a data structure where we store a sequence of data and when we want to use one, we should take the last inserted. 

This means we use a LIFO structure (Last in First Out)

Imagine you put one dish over other and other and other . If you want to use one, you don't necessarily need to take in the middle or the first one. You just use the one on the top of the stack. 

That is a stack data structure!!

To use stack we are going to know the data structures used in Rust (vector and array)
